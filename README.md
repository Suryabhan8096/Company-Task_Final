Driver Drowsiness Detection – Real-Time Computer Vision System

This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using Python and Computer Vision. The system captures live video from a camera, processes frames in real time, and detects driver fatigue based on Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) analysis. When drowsiness is detected, a structured event is generated and communicated to a backend service, with event data stored for further analysis.

🔹 Key Features

Real-time video processing using OpenCV

Face and eye detection with EAR-based drowsiness logic

Event-driven architecture with timestamped alerts

REST API integration for real-time event communication

Event data storage in structured JSON format

Modular and clean code structure

🔹 Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

Flask (REST API)

JSON (Event Storage)

🔹 Use Case

This system helps improve road safety by identifying driver fatigue in real time and can be extended to large-scale monitoring systems using streaming platforms and databases.
